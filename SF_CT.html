<p>
San Francisco Chinatown is a one of the biggest Chinatowns in America. It was always a very special treat whenever my family would drive all the way to the city. It usually meant that we were going to my cousinâ€™s house in the outer Mission or that we were going out to a fancy dinner with extended family. We would leave early afternoon and spend the whole day out there grocery shopping and looking into book shops.
