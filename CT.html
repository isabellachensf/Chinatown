Chinatown is a place that many people overlook. It is filled with movement and culture. From old ladies doing tai chi in the morning to the roast ducks hanging from the windows, I always knew that this is part of my home. I use to love looking at the fish markets and the streets that are filled with overflowing with Asian produce. My family would always go to Chinatown to eat. They have the best and cheapest meals as well as the mostly comforting family style dinners. Although I live a little aways from Chinatown, I still trying to stop as much as I can.
